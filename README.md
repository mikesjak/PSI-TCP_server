# FIT ÄŒVUT
### BI-PSI
- This version scored 20/20 points 
- Was made during my second semester at FIT CTU
- I chose Python due to its Socket library
- *testing_client.py* is not official testing client
    - it was made by myself to secure the authentization proces works
    - checks only first part of the program
- program navigates robot to cordinates [0,0]
- robot might hit into obstacle and needs to go around the most efficient way
### Usage
- simply run server first and then try to log in with client
- IP and port for both server and client needs to be changed inside source code
```
./server.py
./testing_client.py
```
